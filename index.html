            <p class="project-description">
                Introducing an intelligent book recommendation system driven by sophisticated content analysis. Using a comprehensive dataset featuring 1750 books from Kaggle, this project employs advanced content-based filtering techniques. By creating vectors based on various content features such as genre, author, and plot keywords, the system excels at understanding the unique difference and similarity of each book. Users can seamlessly discover new books by inputting their favorite book, and the system responds with a tailored list of content-wise related recommendations. Additionally, the system ensures to suggest all books of the same genre, providing users with a comprehensive selection within their preferred literary landscape. The streamlined frontend, crafted with Streamlit, ensures a user-friendly experience, making book exploration both personalized and enjoyable. This project gives book recommendations by prioritizing content relevance and user satisfaction, while also broadening the reader's horizons within their preferred genres.

            <p class="project-description">
                During my internship at CodSoft, I led the development of several data science projects. These projects involved tasks like filtering data and building models to predict outcomes based on given inputs. I used tools like LogisticRegression, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegression, and Ridge from sklearn to train these models. Additionally, I used seaborn for easy-to-understand data visualization. The data for these projects was obtained from platforms like Kaggle, ensuring its quality and relevance. Some notable projects I worked on include predicting Titanic survival, movie ratings, iris flower types, and sales. Each project required a good grasp of data science concepts and careful model training.

                Led a four-member team during my degree curriculum to develop a project centered around the placement cell. Additionally, I took charge of documentation and preparing the SRS report for the project.<br/><br/>
                The Placement Cell webapp is a dynamic hub connecting students and recruiters seamlessly. Designed for ease of use, students can register, login, and explore a curated list of job opportunities posted by recruiters. The intuitive interface allows students to apply directly to these positions. Recruiters, on the other hand, can effortlessly post job openings, creating a streamlined recruitment process. To foster communication and collaboration, the platform features a dedicated discussion forum where students and recruiters can engage in meaningful conversations, facilitating a robust exchange of information and ideas. This comprehensive solution aims to bridge the gap between talent and opportunities in a digital ecosystem, ensuring a smooth and efficient placement experience for both students and recruiters.
